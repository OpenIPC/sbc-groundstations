## Wifibroadcast Configuration
# wfb_rx_mode can be receiver or aggregator.
# receiver mode: Wifibroadcast works as is. Just automatically generate wifibroadcast configuration files(/etc/wifibroadcast.cfg /etc/default/wifibroadcast) and restart wifibroadcast@gs services when USB WiFi plug and unplug.
# aggregator mode: wfb_rx aggregator running in the background when system boots up, and then start a wfb_rx forwarder for each USB WiFi. You can get stream from USB WiFi or other devices like an OpenWrt via Ethernet. Hot-plugging of USB WiFi or Ethernet will not interrupting data stream. WARING: This mode may introduce additional delays(~1ms?) and not compatible with the wfb-cli api for now. [ TODO ]
